## 0.3.0 (2013-06-24)

* BC break: Switch from (deprecated) `clue/connection-manager` to `react/socket-client`
and thus replace each occurance of `getConnect($host, $port)` with `create($host, $port)` (#1)
* Fix: Timeouts in `ConnectionManagerTimeout` now actually work (#1)
* Fix: Properly reject promise in `ConnectionManagerSelective` when no targets
have been found (#1)

## 0.2.0 (2013-02-08)

* Feature: Add `ConnectionManagerSelective` which works like a network/firewall ACL

## 0.1.0 (2013-01-12)

* First tagged release
